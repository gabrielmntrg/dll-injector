# Overview
A DLL Injector is a tool that allows you to inject a dynamic link library (DLL) into the address space of another process. This is commonly used in debugging, testing, and in some cases, reverse engineering. This project includes:
- Injector.cpp: The injector source code.
- Test Target: A folder containing a target program (Target.cpp) and a DLL (DLL.cpp) to test the injector.

# How to Use the Injector
1. Change the target and the path to the DLL in main function.
2. Compile the Injector using your preferred compiler.
3. Run the Injector.

# Using Test Target
1. Compile Target.cpp to create the target executable.
2. Compile DLL.cpp to create the DLL.
3. Run the Test Target and the Injector.
